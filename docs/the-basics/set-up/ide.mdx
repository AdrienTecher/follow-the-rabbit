# Integrated Development Environment

In short an IDE is a software that enables you to:

- Edit source code.
- Highlight the syntax of the language you are using.
- Navigate the files in your project easily.
- Execute, build and debug your code.
- Many many more things like : viewing the CVS, autocomplete, code snippets, integrated terminals etc...

Let's see how to set up the most popular IDE which also happens to be my favourite (it is popular for a reason) : VSCode.
First install it from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">official website</a>.

Feel free to read the walkthroughs provided within the software or watch tutorials before going on to the next page.

I recommend installing the following <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AdrienTecher.ultimate-base-pack">VSCode extension pack</a> I brought together for you to make your experience more seamless and enjoyable! :ok_woman:
