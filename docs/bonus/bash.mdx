# A light bash intro

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

The most commonly used shell, is the bash shell and here is a very light introduction to it.

Let's go through your first use step by step:

:::note Opening up the Terminal

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows" default>
    Do one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Right-click on the Start menu icon. You can find this button in the
        lower-left corner of your desktop. It will open your Power User Menu
        options in a pop-up.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can also just press <kbd>âŠžWin</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> on your keyboard to
        open this menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternatively, you can right-click on any folder to start Command Prompt
        from a specific directory.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">
    Do one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>

        then click Terminal.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Finder, open the /Applications/Utilities folder, then
        double-click Terminal.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    You know how &#128539;<br></br> But ok, you might be an Ubuntu user so here's
    the shortcut : <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Let's type in some instructions

Type this in your terminal and press enter.

```bash
echo "Hello world"
```

Congratulations :tada: you have just given your computer an instruction and it executed it.<br></br>
The command `echo` just prints out whatever you put afterwards. There are many _shell_ commands you can execute for example:

- `cd` : to move within your filesystem (alias for **c**hange **d**irectory).
- `mkdir`: to create a directory (alias for **m**a**k**e **dir**ectory).
- `touch`: to create a file.
- `ls`: to list the files in the directory you currently are located (alias for **l**i**s**t).
- `rm`: to delete a file or directory (alias for **r**e**m**ove).

:::info
_Folder_ is the term used in the context of graphical user interfaces and _directory_ is the term used in a filesystem's context.
:::

Let's try all of these (type the command and press enter to execute it):

1. `ls` : you should see all the files in the directory.
1. `mkdir iamawesome`: this will create a directory named "iamawesome".
1. `ls` : now you should see the directory you just created in the list.
1. `cd iamawesome`: this will take you to the directory. See how the path on the left has changed.
1. `touch myfile.txt`: you've just created a file!
1. `ls` : do you see it?
1. `cd ..` : you've just moved back to the parent directory.
1. `rm -r -v iamawesome`: the `-r` is to indicate that you want everything in the directory removed and the `-v` is to indicate you want written feedback of the execution.

Now let's combine them in one line with the `&&` operator, and add another command to write in a file. Write anything you want and do <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> when you are done.

```shell
mkdir mydir && cd mydir && touch hello.txt && cat > hello.txt
```

Now look at what you have written with the command `cat hello.txt`.

**Ok** , let's stop here, sooner or later you will have to use it again...<br></br><br></br>
There is so much more you can do, so if you are curious you can watch the video below (2m32s) and play around with scripts when you'd like to feel like a computer god.
