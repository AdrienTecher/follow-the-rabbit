# Welcome!

The purpose of this guide is to help you navigate the world of programming and provide you with ressources to start your learning adventure. The point of this guide is not to get you up to the level of a software engineer or even a freelance junior programmer but to get you to the point where it's easy for you to :

- Speak with a programmer with an understanding of their job, methodology and tools.
- Have the basic setup and vocabulary to find the resources to learn and apply any skill or concept in the information technology domain.

Let's go and have fun!
