The easiest way you can start feeling and thinking like a programmer is to use the terminal.

It may be intimidating but you will know how to use your computer directly and more efficiently.
Even if you don't plan on becoming a full-time programmer, knowing how to use your terminal will elevate you to the rank of power-user.

Here below are short tutorials based on your operating system to get you started (recommended), you can also check out the [light bash introduction](../bonus/bash) I made (optional).
