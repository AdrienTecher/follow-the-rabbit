# What is it to _code_ ?

In the most general sense a code either a system of statements, principles or rules or of symbols and signals used for communication. In the world of information technology, _code_ is just instructions destined for a machine. A set of the those instructions that would be read/executed in sequence is called a _program_. So in a very simple manner, we can say that programming is the activity that consists of **writing sequences of instructions for a computer to execute**.
