## Some excellent free introductory courses

Note that these are recommendations based on all the courses I have been exposed to, not all that exist.

- [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) : probably the most famous and one of the best introductory programming course out there.
  This is more suited for people who want to go quite deep into programming. If you are a law student or a buisness professionnal, they have declined this course to tailor it for those domains.
- [Nature, in Code: Biology in JavaScript](https://www.edx.org/course/nature-in-code-biology-in-javascript): great if you want to learn by modeling real-world phenomena.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn): amazing, the kind of website that should exist.
