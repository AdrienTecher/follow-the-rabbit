# Your first code - Putting it all together

If you've followed the tutorial so far, you have a basic understanding fo what is terminal, a cvs, an IDE and have set up git, GitHub and VSCode. You are more than ready to link it all together and come closer to a real dev experience.

As of now you might never have written actual code in a file, only commands in the terminal. Let's remedy that right away.

In the next chapter we will see how to choose a programming language to start with but for now we will just code a "Hello, World!" program in some of the main programming languages out there, namely:

- Python
- Javascript
- Java
- C++
- HTML

:::note The "Hello, World!" program

From Wikipedia :

"A 'Hello, World!'' program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!".
Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language.
It is often the first program written by people learning to code.
It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it."

We'll do that in these few steps:

1. Create a GitHub repository.
1. Clone it locally with a git command.
1. Create a source file in a language.
1. Compile, run or open the file (how we do that will depend on the language).
1. Stage the file and commit.
1. Repeat Step 3, 4 and 5 for each languages.
1. Push our commits to the remote repository on GitHub.
1. Celebrate!

We will all of this via the GitHub website for Step 1 and on VSCode for the rest.
